Alanna Brown at Puppet [interviewed](https://puppetlabs.com/blog/james-pogran-learning-powershell-dsc) me about the book I wrote about PowerShell DSC. We talked about my background and how I came about to write this book. The most important thing to me was trying to impart all the experiences I had using DSC in production to deploy applications on many disparate systems.
