I’m James Pogran, a software developer. My day to day job keeps me fairly busy, but I try to balance that with my wife and three kids and two dogs.

I have been working with computers in some form or fashion for over 15 years. My first job was systems administration for a large military installation. I then moved on to developing monitoring software and automating large scale Windows environments for a major managed services provider.

I am now a Software Engineer at [Puppet](https://puppet.com) on the Modules team helping to make Windows automation even better with Puppet. I have written a [book](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-powershell-dsc) or [two](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-powershell-dsc-second-edition), and contribute to several OSS projects on [github](https://github.com/jpogran).

I love finding out how things work, taking them apart, and making them work faster.
