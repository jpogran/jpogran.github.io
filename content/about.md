![James Pogran:left](../img/avatar-sm.jpg) I am a Principal Software Engineer at Puppet helping to make Windows automation even better with Puppet.

I helped make the [Puppet VS Code Extension](https://pup.pt/) a reality, currently on the Bolt team on their PowerShell interface.

I have been working with computers in some form or fashion for over 15 years. My first job was systems administration for a large military installation. I then moved on to developing monitoring software and automating large scale Windows environments for a major managed services provider.

I love finding out how things work, taking them apart, and making them work faster.
