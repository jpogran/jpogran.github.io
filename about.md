## What I do

I am a Software Engineer at [Puppet Labs](https://puppetlabs.com/) on the Modules team helping to make Windows automation even better with Puppet.

I have been working with computers in some form or fashion for over 15 years. My first job was systems administration for a large military installation. I then moved on to developing monitoring software and automating large scale Windows environments for a major managed services provider.

## Why I do it

I love finding out how things work, taking them apart, and making them work faster.

## What I do for fun

Playing with my kids and spending time with my wife.

Thanks for reading!
