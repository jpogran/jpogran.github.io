I'm James Pogran, a software developer. My day to day job keeps me fairly busy, but I try to balance that with my wife and two kids and two dogs. I am a Software Engineer at [Puppet Labs](https://puppetlabs.com/) on the Modules team helping to make Windows automation even better with Puppet. I have been working with computers in some form or fashion for over 15 years. My first job was systems administration for a large military installation. I then moved on to developing monitoring software and automating large scale Windows environments for a major managed services provider. I love finding out how things work, taking them apart, and making them work faster.
